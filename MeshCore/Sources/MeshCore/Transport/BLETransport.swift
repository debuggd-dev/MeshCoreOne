/// Implements a Bluetooth Low Energy transport for MeshCore devices.
///
/// `BLETransport` uses the Nordic UART Service (NUS) to provide a serial-like communication
/// channel over BLE. It manages the full lifecycle of a BLE connection, from scanning and
/// discovery to service and characteristic negotiation.
///
/// ## State Management
///
/// This implementation is an `actor`, ensuring that all mutable state (connection status,
/// peripheral references, and characteristics) is isolated and protected from concurrent
/// access. It uses modern Swift concurrency patterns, including `AsyncStream` for data
/// reception and checked continuations for bridging delegate-based callbacks to `async` methods.
///
/// ## Nordic UART Service (NUS)
///
/// The transport relies on two specific characteristics:
/// - **RX (Write)**: Used to send data packets to the MeshCore device.
/// - **TX (Notify)**: Used to receive data packets from the MeshCore device via notifications.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let transport = BLETransport()
/// try await transport.connect()
///
/// // Start listening for data
/// Task {
///     for await data in await transport.receivedData {
///         print("Received \(data.count) bytes")
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Send data
/// try await transport.send(Data([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]))
/// ```
