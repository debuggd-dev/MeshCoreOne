/// Represents a contact stored on the MeshCore device.
///
/// `MeshContact` defines a node in the mesh network that your device has discovered or stored.
/// Contacts are typically discovered through advertisements and are used as message destinations.
///
/// ## Identity
/// Each contact has a unique 32-byte public key. The ``id`` property
/// is the hex string representation for use with SwiftUI's `Identifiable`.
///
/// ## Routing
/// The ``outPath`` and ``outPathLength`` describe the routing path to reach
/// this contact. A path length of `0xFF` indicates flood routing (broadcast to all).
///
/// The ``outPathLength`` byte uses bit packing to encode both the hash size and hop count:
/// - Upper 2 bits (6-7): hash size mode (0=1-byte, 1=2-byte, 2=3-byte, 3=reserved)
/// - Lower 6 bits (0-5): hop count (0-63)
///
/// Use ``pathHashSize``, ``pathHopCount``, and ``pathByteLength`` to decode these fields.
///
/// ## Location
/// If the contact shares its location, ``latitude`` and ``longitude``
/// contain GPS coordinates.
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// // Find a contact by name
/// if let contact = session.getContactByName("MyNode") {
///     try await session.sendMessage(to: contact.publicKey, text: "Hello!")
/// }
///
/// // Check routing mode
/// if contact.isFloodPath {
///     print("\(contact.advertisedName) uses flood routing")
/// }
/// ```
